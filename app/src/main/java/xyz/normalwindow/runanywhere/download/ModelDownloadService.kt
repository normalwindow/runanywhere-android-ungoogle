/**
 * Foreground service that owns a model download so it survives the app being backgrounded and the
 * screen turning off.
 *
 * Without a started foreground service + wake lock, Doze suspends the collecting coroutine the
 * moment the screen sleeps mid-download, stalling multi-GB NPU bundles indefinitely. This service:
 *  - runs `RunAnywhere.models.download(...)` in its **own** scope (not a ViewModel/Activity scope
 *    that dies with the UI),
 *  - holds a `PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK` so the CPU keeps servicing the socket in Doze,
 *  - shows a progress notification carrying the same size/rate/ETA line the picker row does, and
 *  - publishes the transfer on [active] / [interrupted] so every picker mirrors it.
 *
 * Cancellation cancels the collecting job; the SDK's `downloadModel` `finally` block then fires the
 * native cancel with `delete_partial_bytes = false`, so resume bytes are preserved for a later
 * retry — a re-issued download continues from the `.part` sidecar rather than starting over.
