/**
 * Runtime view of which inference backends can actually serve a model on this
 * build + device, so the pickers can hide/disable rows whose backend is absent.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 * The catalog is shared across every SDK build flavor, but a given APK only
 * packages a subset of native backends (e.g. an NPU-only slice ships QHexRT but
 * not the Sherpa speech JNI). A row whose backend is missing looks tappable and
 * then hard-fails at load with `-422 "No provider could handle the request"`.
 * Filtering on availability turns that silent failure into an honest
 * "unavailable" state.
 *
 * ## Signal sources (all best-effort — the SDK exposes no public
 * "list registered backends" query)
 * - **QHEXRT** — [QHexRT.probeNpu] is a real public device probe; a part outside
 *   the V75/V79/V81 support set (or an x86 emulator) reports
 *   `supported = false`. This is authoritative and correct for both the
 *   NPU-only and the full build.
 * - **LlamaCPP / ONNX / Sherpa** — no public runtime signal exists. The SDK
 *   modules register these at bootstrap and swallow failures (logging, never
 *   throwing to the app), so we cannot observe the outcome from the app module.
 *   [reportRegistration] lets bootstrap forward what it learned; until it does,
 *   these default to **available** so a full build never wrongly hides a working
 *   row. The limitation: on a build that fails to package one of these JNIs and
 *   does not call [reportRegistration], its rows stay visible and fail at load
 *   exactly as before — no worse than today, better once the hook is wired.
