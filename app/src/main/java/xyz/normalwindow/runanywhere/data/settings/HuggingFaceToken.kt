/**
 * Storing a Hugging Face sign-in is three things that have to happen together — an encrypted
 * write, the SDK's live credential, and a catalog refresh so the gated rows appear — and each of
 * them can fail differently.
 *
 * It lives here rather than in whichever screen happens to own a text field because two surfaces
 * now ask for the token: Settings, and the model picker at the moment a private model is tapped.
 * Two copies of this sequence would drift, and the one that drifted would leave a token saved but
 * not applied.
