/**
 * The single motion vocabulary for the app, pinned to `examples/DESIGN_GUIDELINE.md` §6.
 *
 * Four duration tiers and four springs, shared verbatim with the iOS and Web apps so the
 * same interaction moves at the same speed on every platform. A duration that is not one
 * of these tiers is a bug, not a preference — that is why the tiers are the only public
 * entry point and raw `tween(220)`-style literals do not appear at call sites.
 *
 * Every discrete helper here is reduce-motion aware: when the user has turned animation
 * off, discrete motion collapses to a 150 ms crossfade (perceived, not blinked past) and
 * repeating motion is *suppressed entirely* rather than shortened — a looping animation
 * that has merely been made faster still loops forever. Read
 * [LocalReduceMotion] for the flag; use [ambient] for anything that repeats.
