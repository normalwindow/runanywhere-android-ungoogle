 * `OpenDocument` is given a MIME filter — but that is a convenience, not a guarantee: a document
 * provider can hand back a type it never advertised, and the size limits are ours, not the
 * picker's. Without this check a 40 MB PDF is accepted cheerfully and then fails several seconds
 * later inside extraction, where the message reads as the model having gone wrong rather than the
 * file having been too big. Refusing at attach time puts the sentence next to the decision.
 *
 * Every limit here is the one the downstream path actually enforces: documents defer to
 * [DocumentExtractor], so the two can never disagree about the same file.
 *
 * Shared with the Vision screen, which stages images through the same funnel — one definition of
 * "can this file be attached" rather than two that drift.
