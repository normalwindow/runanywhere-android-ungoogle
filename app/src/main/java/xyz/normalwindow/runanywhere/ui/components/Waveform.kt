/**
 * A live microphone waveform, drawn.
 *
 * Replaces the three hand-rolled `LevelBars` copies (STT, VAD, diarization), each of which
 * lit a fixed staircase of 12 bars from the *current* level only. That renders a VU meter,
 * not a signal: it says how loud the room is right now and forgets everything else, so a
 * pause between words looked identical to a dead microphone.
 *
 * This keeps a short rolling history and scrolls it right-to-left, so the shape of what the
 * user just said stays visible — which is the thing that tells them capture is working. The
 * newest sample is at the right edge under the brand gradient; older samples fade back.
 *
 * Motion here is *data*, not decoration: bars move because audio arrived, so reduced motion
 * does not suppress it (§6.5 governs ambient loops). Each new level shifts the history one
 * slot, so a quiet stretch walks in as hairlines and the shape of the last phrase drains off
 * the left edge; an unchanging level parks the trace rather than animating a signal that is
 * not there.
