 * this device the gap between pressing send and the first token was measured at ~2.6 s,
 * which a bare row of dots renders as a hang. So the wait names itself, and escalates
 * its own wording as it goes — reporting the app's own elapsed wait, never inventing
 * engine state it cannot observe.

/**
 * Three pips breathing out of phase, so the group reads as a travelling wave — the "thinking"
 * idiom — rather than three lights blinking in unison.
 *
 * **One clock, three phases.** An earlier version gave each pip its own
 * `rememberInfiniteTransition` with a `delayMillis` offset; inside `infiniteRepeatable` that
 * delay is re-applied at the *start of every cycle*, so the pips did not run a third of a
 * period apart — they each stalled, and the wave came apart within a couple of seconds. This
 * runs one 0→ phase value and derives each pip's opacity from it, which is phase-locked by
 * construction and costs one animation instead of three.
 *
 * Alpha is applied via `graphicsLayer`, so a frame is a compositor property change rather
 * than a re-draw of three shapes. Under reduced motion the row is simply steady.
