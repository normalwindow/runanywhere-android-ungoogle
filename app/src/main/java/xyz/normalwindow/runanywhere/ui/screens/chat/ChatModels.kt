     * failed turn used to be an ordinary assistant bubble — same ink, same markdown rendering,
     * same Regenerate affordance — so the app attributed its own error text to the model.
     * Worse, `ChatRequestPolicy` fed every non-blank assistant turn back as history, which
     * meant the next request told the model it had previously said "Error: Backend not
     * available for: llm" and it began apologising for a failure it had no part in.
